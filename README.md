# Shade

Simple theme based on [The Shell](https://github.com/mityalebedev/The-Shell) for my website using [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/).

- Pure CSS (SCSS included)
- Websafe fonts
- Added syntax highlighting with PrismJS

You can find a live example [here](https://ghost.moso.io).

# Editing the source
Install the node modules:
```
npm install
```

Do your edits, and then compile the SCSS to CSS with gulp:
```
gulp
```
